ndg for Debian
--------------

Now that you've installed the ndg package, a final step is required to set
everything up. You must run the script `ndg-post-install.sh` located in
/usr/share/doc/ndg. This script will download, install, and configure JBoss and
create symlinks to your NDG installation jars so they can be used.
